# Metagenomics
Codes for metagenomics project.
This repo contains chunks of codes for metagenomics project where coding DNA sequence of human gut microbiome containing gut bacteria were used to predict microRNA.

Each script is self explanatory, and does the job as explained by its title, eg CDS2mRNA reads FASTA (/txt) file from the working directory, converts them to corresponding mRNA sequence, and also takes care of forward and reverse strand, as necessary.
The codes are written in Biopython.
